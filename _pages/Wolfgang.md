Wolfgang Heidrich is a Professor of Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering in the [KAUST](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/vcc/) Visual Computing Center, for which he also served as director from 2014 to 2021. Prof. Heidrich joined King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in 2014, after 13 years as a faculty member at [the University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/). He received his PhD in from [the University of Erlangen](https://www.fau.eu/) in 1999, and then worked as a Research Associate in the Computer Graphics Group of [the Max-Planck-Institute for Computer Science](https://www.cis.mpg.de/) in Saarbrucken, Germany, before joining UBC in 2000.<br>
 Prof. Heidrich’s research interests lie at the intersection of imaging, optics, computer vision, computer graphics, and inverse problems. His more recent interest is in computational imaging, focusing on hardware-software co-design of the next generation of imaging systems, with applications such as High-Dynamic Range imaging, compact computational cameras, hyperspectral cameras, to name just a few. Prof. Heidrich’s work on High Dynamic Range Displays served as the basis for the technology behind Brightside Technologies, which was acquired by Dolby in 2007. Prof. Heidrich is a Fellow of the IEEE, AAIA, and Eurographics, and the recipient of a Humboldt Research Award as well as the ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics Achievement Award.
