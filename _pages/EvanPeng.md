I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Hong Kong Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Computer Science . Before joining HKU, I was a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at the Stanford University Computational Imaging Laboratory. I received my PhD in Computer Science from the Imager Lab, the University of British Columbia. During the PhD, I was a Visiting Student Researcher at Visual Computing Center, KAUST, and at Stanford University. I received both my MS and BS in Optical Science and Engineering from State Key Lab of Modern Optical Instrumentation, Zhejiang University.

My research interest lies in the interdisciplinary field of Optics, Graphics, Vision, and Artificial Intelligence, particularly with the focus of: Computational Optics, Sensing, and Display; Holographic Imaging/Display & VR/AR/MR; Computational Microscope Imaging; Low-level Computer Vision; Inverse Rendering; Human-centered Visual & Sensory Systems.
