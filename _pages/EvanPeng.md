I am an Assistant Professor at HKU [Electrical & Electronic Engineering](https://www.eee.hku.hk/) and [Computer Science , leading the Computational Imaging & Mixed Representation Labortary, aka., WeLight@HKU.](http://weshapelight.com/)

I was a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at [Stanford University Computational Imaging Laboratory](http://computationalimaging.org/). I received my PhD in Computer Science from the Imager Lab, [the University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/). During the PhD, I was a Visiting Student Researcher at Visual Computing Center, [KAUST](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/vcc/), and at Stanford. I received both my MS and BS in Optical Science and Engineering from the State Key Lab of Modern Optical Instrumentation, [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/research/list.htm).

My research interest lies in the interdisciplinary field of Optics, Graphics, Vision, and Artificial Intelligence, particularly with the focus of: Computational Optics, Imager, Sensor, and Display; Holographiy & VR/AR/MR; Coded Microscope Imaging; Low-level Computer Vision; Inverse Rendering; Human-centered Visual & Sensory Systems.
